Technology stack:

1. MEAN Stack, web3.js
2. Andorid for app
3. Ethererum (Solidity) for smart contract
4. Truffle for deplyoing smart contarcts.


We are trying to solve the issues in current health scenario.

# CURRENT SCENARIO

* Varying data standards reduce interoperability because records are not compatible between systems. 
* Limited access to population health data
* Inconsistent rules and permissions inhibit the right health organization from accessing the right patient data at the right time. 

# How blockchain is solving this
* Distributed, secure access to patient longitudinal health data across the distributed ledger
* Shared data enables near real-time updates across the network to all parties. 
* Distributed framework for patient digital identities, which uses private and public identifiers secured through cryptography, creates a singular, more secure method of protecting patient identity.
* Smart contracts create a consistent, rule-based method for accessing patient data that can be permissioned to selected health organizations. 
* A blockchain solution could address the HIPAA Privacy Rule by separating and encrypting identity, PII, and PHI.
